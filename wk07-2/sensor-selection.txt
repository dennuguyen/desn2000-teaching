1. Identify list of sensors for your project
2. Identify sensor constraints
	- budget
	- size
	- sampling rate
	- any other data requirements
3. GOOGLE & find an appropriate model
	- Jaycar
	- Core electronics
	- RS Pro
4. Write pseudocode for how to use the sensor
5. Perform power requirements (optional)
	- Helps to draw a circuit diagram
	- What is average power draw to turn on sensors? Therefore what battery capacity needed?
